### Overview

In this project, the goal is to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. The 5 ways are described as Class A,B,C,D and E, the meaning of each class is below:

Class A means exactly according to the specification.
Class B means throwing the elbows to the front.
Class C means lifting the dumbbell only halfway.
Class D means lowering the dumbbell only halfway.
Class E throwing the hips to the front.

We would build machine learning models to quantify how well they do it.
