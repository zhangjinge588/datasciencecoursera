## Introduction

- An Interactive Tool to fetch the next word.
- Construct Multi-Million Document Corpus from News, Blogs and Twitter.
- Leverage Stupid Backoff Algorithm and Acheive nearly Real-Time Results.


## Algorithm

- Tokenize input data sources by the following strategies:
  - Case Insensitivity
  - Puncuation and other symbols removal.
  - Remove links, numbers, extra white spaces.

- Construct Unigram, Bigram and Trigram model and cache them.

- The stupid backoff algorithm behaves as the following:
  - Iterate from trigram to unigram.
  - Generating the score based on what is matching.
  - Returns the words with top N scores.

## User Interface

- A Text Input, 2 Slider Controls.
- Type your words in Text Input
- Configure 2 parameters in sidebar sliders.
  - Choose your N value to select top N most likely next word.
